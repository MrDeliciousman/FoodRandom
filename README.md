# FoodRandom(RanFoo)

## generate a random food plate


* Random Food
 * The basic functionality will be to randomize food based on something the users types and return a name, picture and list of ingredients to see if that would be something they would like to make.
 * I feel that the people that would be intersted are those people that have no clue as to the many ways you can cook something and this will open the door to more opportunities to explore different dishes. I often have this problem and think it would be nice to have something like this.

 # User Stories
 	
  * AS A/AN...  I WANT TO...	 SO THAT...
 	* As a (User) I want to (Have a system that can take what I like and make a random decision) so that (I dont have to decide what to make for a meal.) 
 	* As a (User) I want to (Be able to have something that will Conture to my dietary restrictions) so that (I dont have to worry.)

* This app could be used with out a internet connection as it takes choices the user puts in and randomizes it based on the user imput and preferences
 * At the moment I cannot think of a simple way to make this connected to the internet and use a data base as it would mainly rely on the individual. Something might become aparent after further development.
 * At the time of this there are no bugs I am aware of. There are however a couple things that I given more time would have liked to implemented. This includes three main things... The first is having the search result fragment be saved on the back stack and not disapear everytime you switch between fragments. The second is being able to delete an item in the list of saved fragments. The third is to enable a link that will take the user to the yummily website so they can see preperation instructions as well as tutorial videos on the result they get back. Besides that I beleive my app Is about complete.
